The typescript file( * .ts) will be compiled into js file with same name( * .js), as soon as you save the typescript
file.
<h3>2.1 With the help of declaration code, any legal js code is legal typescript code.</h3>
That means, if you copy a legal js code to typescript file, the code is legal too.
Therefore, typescript is considered to be the superset of javascript.

Most common js libraries' declaration for typescript can be installed by
[nuget](http://www.nuget.org/packages?q=DefinitelyTyped) or found on
[DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped).
<h3>2.2 It's an Object-Oriented language, a class can include constructor and private members, and a class can be

The left side is typescript code, and the right side is the generated js code.
<h2>3. <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a></h2>
The LESS file( * .less) will be compiled into CSS file with same name( * .css), as soon as you save the LESS file.
<h3>3.1 Any legal CSS code is legal LESS code.</h3>
